# CSQ

CSQ is a Squirrel language runtime for developing applications using the Squirrel scripting language. It comes with 

* A GUI API that wraps and polishes up some of the Gtk API. 
* An API for the file system
* Some network functions
* A plugin system that allows CSQ to be extended with native modules using Vala or C
* Good integration with GObjects


CSQ intends to be a bit like NodeJS but with a focus on

* the desktop, as opposed to the web
* stability. built on a web established foundation of Squirrel and Gtk.
* Integration with existing libraries though gobject introspection, though this may come at a later time as a girepository module. 
* obviously, Squirrel rather than Javascript
